a note to myself from future:

hello me from the future, in order to publish artifact in sonatype, you have to invoke following providing specific properties:

RELEASE_TYPE=SNAPSHOT \
SIGNING_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SIGNING_KEY_PATH=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SONATYPE_USERNAME=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SONATYPE_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
gradlew clean publishArtifact i

checkout the artifacts in here:
https://oss.sonatype.org/

firstly SNAPSHOT, then RELEASE.

"yours" sincerely,
you from the past

PS. you have a mess in your gpg keys, so if something is f*cked up - you deserved it
